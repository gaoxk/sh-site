		'StarterHacks was my first hackathon ever. I vividly remember constantly brainstorming ideas with my group, dedicating time to our pitch... getting the award felt like a major accomplishment, as the hard work paid off. It just goes to show that even if you’re a first time hacker, there will definitely be something to gain from the Hackathon.',
		'I really enjoyed being in a collaborative environment, sharing ideas with peers and pushing each other to the next level of creativity and innovation. At StarterHacks I learned that hackathons are not just about coding, but are also about design, prototyping, business, and creativity.'
